# dotfiles
This is a repo where I store all of my most important configuration files (bashrc, vimrc etc...)
This configuration files have been written slowly as I have been learning programming to suit my needs, so be carful if you want to
eventually use them.
## Main requisites:
- Arch Linux/pacman (some aliases are pacman)
- git (there is some git integration insde the prompt)
