# dotfiles
This is a repo where I store all of my most important configuration files (bashrc, vimrc etc...)
This configuration files have been written slowly as I have been learning programming to suit my needs, so be carful if you want to eventually use them.
## Main requisites:
- Arch Linux/pacman (some aliases are pacman)
- vim (I have a .vimrc file)
-- vim plugins:
--- none for now
- git (there is some git integration inside the prompt)
